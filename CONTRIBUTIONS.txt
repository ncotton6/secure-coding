In the beginning of the project I worked on reading documentation of what a
Rootkit is and what some of the typical functionality that they provide to 
an end user (hackers).  With this information helped to create an 
application design that could be used to build a simplistic rootkit that 
could infect a computer.  Fairly early on I wrote some code that would allow
for the X11 library to be used to log the keys that user typed in.  From
there I explored how this keylogger could be integrated into a rootkit to
provide some additional functionality (a complete rootkit would have more
features than just a keylogger). 

I designed the rootkit to tap into the keylogger to collect the keys and 
send them to an external server.  From there I worked with Praful and Hongyu
to create a networking module using UDP to connect the infected computer
to the external server.  During this process a message format needed to be
developed to overcome the lack of reliability that UDP has. On the server
I wrote the portion that reconstructed the segmented data that the infected
computer could potentially send.

Finally, I worked on creating the poster and writing up the report for this
project.
